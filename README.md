# ML-PROJECT-TITANIC
# Contents of the Notebook
The notebook contains code,roughly, under the following points -

Introduction to the Problem
Looking at the data at a glance
Filling in missing values of the dataset
Outlier Handling
Exploratory Data Analysis
Feature Engineering
Performing the same operations on the test set
Model Creation using RandomForestClassifier
About the classifier
Mainly, for the Classifier, I have used K-Fold cross validation on the training set and using RandomForestClassifier, I got the least difference between the accuracy and the cross validation score.

Improvements
I haven't tried hyperparameter tuning on this model, neither have I tried Stacking. Using these might improve the accuracy.

My Favourite part
My favourite part about the notebook would be the Exploratory Data Analysis part, where I used seaborn and matplotlib to plot a lot of different graphs to draw various insights from the dataset.
